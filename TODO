TODO

- fix "copy" inheritance problem (see dom/events.js) by using
  true JS inheritance for the Node clone family? This might also
  fix the fragile ordering of loaded files/packages
- get gezira rendering going again. Need to hook into
  dom.graphics.update() to repaint
- create google group?
- notify env.js group?
- test with some more code
- make all gezira parents (groups, too?) point to a default
  gezira (blank) object upon creation? This "null" node could be
  used in several places
- Fix getTransformToElement
- SVG ellipse is not elliptic enough at large sizes. The
  radius should be factored into the bezier calculation
  (which is trivial to so)
- I should look at the "fill-opacity" attribute to grab
  alpha of fill color.
- need to rewrite setAttributeNS to reuse the attr node, not
  create a whole new one each time
- rename geziraBegin/geziraEnd to _gezira.begin/_gezira.end?
- get to run again on the n800
- ideally I'd have a object mapping to and from dom and gezira objects.
  This would get rid of the domObject.gezira hack, and allow for the
  hit testing to work. Expose a hash table object? Or a special purpose
  function?
- Fix memory leaks of gezira objects. Must install a finalizer gezira
  JS objects.
- expose a window.height window.width getters (and setters?)
- an element may be added to the dom render queue multiple times because
  multiple attributes of that element are changed in a given phase. Should
  we do a uniq() on that queue then? How much of a win does this get
  me? Can either == or === get me a fast object id-like comparison?
- write glue code for other JS engines, window/events libraries and
  graphics renderers
    - v8
    - squirrelfish
    - rhino
- plug in an (X)HTML parser (see OMeta/JS)
- To make our (X)HTML output the same as FF, we need to:
    - support doctype
    - the script tags, plus the "1" child text node in each
    - don't emit </endtags> for elements that don't (can't?) have
      children (e.g., <stop />)
    - don't emit implied args for transforms (e.g., translate(0 0))
    - don't output default implied values (or keep track if they have been
      changed (specified))
    - no newlines for text nodes
    - spaces/commas for lists
    - same order of the attributes
- network functionality. Bindings to libcurl (or something like it)
- CSS
